Appointment scheduling

### Project Overview

This is a simple appointment scheduling application. Users can easily manage it. This is a quick way for users schedule an appointment. 
We have three intents here. The first one is login. It is necessary to enter a username and password. Other intent displays information about the term. Here the user chooses the hour and the date when he wants to schedule an appointment. If the term before 5 pm, then the price is 25 euros. The third intent is the success of the appointment. When you press the button schedule it, prints the mesage that the dates scheduled. Send button sends a message to the administrator that the term succesfully scheduled.
